# ink-Unity integration

This Unity package allows you to integrate inkle's [ink narrative scripting language](http://www.inklestudios.com/ink) with Unity, and provides tools to help quickly test your stories in-editor.

Features:

 - **Running ink in game**: Allows usage of JSON-compiled ink files in Unity via the included `ink-engine.dll` (and Json.Net dependency).

 - **Auto Compilation**: Instantly creates and updates a JSON story file when a `.ink` is updated. Errors in your `.ink` script are displayed as errors in Unity's own console.
 	
 - **Ink Player**: Provides a powerful player window for playing and debugging stories.
 	
 - **Inspector tools**: Provides an icon for ink files, and a custom inspector that provides information about a file.


## Getting started

* Download the [latest Unity package release](https://github.com/inkle/ink/releases), and add to your Unity project.
* Select one of the sample `.ink` stories included in the package. In Unity's Inspector window, you should see a *Play* button. Click it to open the **ink player** window, useful for playing (previewing) ink stories.

For more information on **ink**, see [the documentation in the main ink repo](https://github.com/inkle/ink). For convenience, the package also creates an (**Ink > Help**) menu option.

## Customisation

This package has been designed to be modular. You can delete many of the folders to remove functionality without causing errors.

You should never delete the DLL folder (although you may delete the windows/mac dlls if you are sure no team members are on a certain platform)

## Using ink in game your game. 

The **ink player** is the core feature of this package; the minimal requirements to actually run a compiled JSON story file are the `ink-engine.dll` and `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` libraries.

## Ink Player

The Ink Player (**Ink > Player Window**) allows you to play stories in an editor window, and provides functionality to edit variables on the fly, save and load states, and divert.

To play a story, drag in a compiled ink story TextAsset.


## Automatic compilation
	
Ink files must be compiled to JSON before they can be used in-game. 
	
This package provides tools to automate this process when a .ink file is edited. 

**Disabling auto-compilation**: You might want to have manual control over ink compilation. If this is the case, you can safely delete the InkPostProcessor class.

**Manual compilation**: If you have disabled auto-compilation, you can manually compile ink using the **Ink > Compile All** menu item, via the inspector of an ink file, or using the functions in the InkCompiler class.

## Inspector Tools

This package also replaces the icon for ink files to make them easier to spot, and populates the inspector for a selected ink file.

**The Inspector**: To replace the inspector for ink files, we've created a system that allows you to provide a custom inspector for any file. If this conflicts with existing behaviour in your project, you can delete the Ink Inspector folder altogether.

## Updating Ink manually

The ink git repo is updated far more frequently than this asset store package. 

If you're interested in keeping up-to-date with cutting edge features, you can download the [latest releases from the GitHub repo](https://github.com/inkle/ink/releases).

## FAQ

* Is the Linux Unity Editor supported?

  *We haven't implemented it, although it should be easy enough by running inklecate.exe with mono. Take a look at `InkCompiler.cs` if you want to add it.*

* I'm getting this error:

        Internal compiler error. See the console log for more information. output was:
        Unhandled Exception: System.TypeLoadException: Could not load type 'Newtonsoft.Json.Linq.JContainer' from assembly 'Newtonsoft.Json, Version=6.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=30ad4fe6b2a6aeed'.`
 	
 	You need to change your API compatibility level from .NET 2.0 subset to .NET 2.0.
